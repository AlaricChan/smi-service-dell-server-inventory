Purpose
~~~~~~~

Connects via the IDRAC on a Dell server and collects a comprehensive inventory.

The dell-server-inventory container is a stateless spring-boot microservice that exposes a REST API for the purpose of returning a comprehensive JSON formatted inventory of a Dell 11th generation and newer server.

The service can be called without a callback URL in order to run synchronously. If a callback URL is provided in the payload, the service will return immediately and post to the callback URL when the results
are available.

How to Use
~~~~~~~~~~

A docker container for this service is available at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/rackhd/dell-server-inventory/
....
docker run --name service-server-inventory -p 0.0.0.0:46011:46011 -d rackhd/dell-server-inventory:latest
....

The service can also start up to bootstrap its configuration from consul. More information about registration with and using advanced configuration settings provided by a Consul K/V store can be found in
the online help.
